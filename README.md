### Vision and Scope

#### Scope:
The BUCK$ expense tracker will focus on core functionalities that enable users to track their daily expenses, categorize transactions, set monthly budgets. The project will also include features such as income and expense logging. While the app will offer financial goal setting, it will not include complex investment tracking, tax preparation tools, or integration with advanced financial management platforms such as stock trading or crypto wallets. These advanced features, while potentially useful, fall outside the scope of this project to ensure that BUCK$ remains simple and user-friendly, focused primarily on personal budgeting and expense management.

#### Vision:
The vision for BUCK$ is to empower individuals to take control of their personal finances through a simple, intuitive, and reliable expense tracking tool. By the time the project is completed, BUCK$ will offer users a seamless experience in managing their money, helping them build better financial habits and make informed decisions. The world after BUCK$ is one where users are more financially aware and equipped with the tools they need to stay on budget, save money, and achieve their financial goals, all through a hassle-free platform that supports them without requiring extensive financial expertise.

## Description/Motivation
